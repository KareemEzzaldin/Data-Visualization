- Shows the most commonly preferred car models.
- Helps customers spot popular choices.
- Guides manufacturers on market trends.

### Column Chart — Car Models and Their Prices
- Displays prices for different models.
- Helps customers compare and budget.

### Funnel Chart — Engine Type vs. Horsepower
- Connects engine types with horsepower levels.
- Helps manufacturers fine-tune engine specs.
- Guides customers in choosing performance levels.

### Drag-Ordering Bar Chart — Cylinder Number vs. Horsepower
- Shows how cylinder count relates to horsepower.
- Useful for engineering and performance analysis.

### Column Chart — Fuel Type vs. Average Mileage
- Compares how fuel type affects city and highway mileage.
- Useful for understanding fuel efficiency impacts.

## 4. Dashboard Layout Rationale

- **Top of Dashboard**
  - **Overall Title**: Provides context at a glance.
  - **Pie Chart (Car Models)**: Grabs attention with most popular models first.
  - **Fuel Type Mileage Chart**: Highlights efficiency differences upfront.

- **Middle Section**
  - **Funnel Chart (Engine Type vs. Horsepower)**: Targets engineering decisions.
  - **Car Price Chart**: Helps budget-conscious users explore options.

- **Bottom Section**
  - **Cylinder vs. Horsepower Chart**: Supports technical comparison and engine planning.

## 5. Design Considerations and Critiques

### Color Choices
- High contrast used to differentiate between fuel types, engine specs, car models.
- Improves clarity and user engagement.

### Logical Aggregation
- Related metrics (e.g., fuel type and mileage, engine size and horsepower) grouped together.
- Enhances the story and keeps context intact.

### Comparative Analysis
- Placing horsepower and cylinder data close together allows direct comparison.
- Supports both technical analysis and customer decision-making.
